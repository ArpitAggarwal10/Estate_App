# AGGARWAL ESTATE

### This real estate project developed using the MERN stack shows a web application that leverages MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js to create a comprehensive platform for managing and showcasing real estate properties. The project utilizes MongoDB as the database to store and manage diverse real estate data. Express.js is employed as the backend framework to handle server-side operations and API requests. The frontend of the real estate project is built using React.js, a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Node.js serves as the runtime environment for the server side, ensuring fast and efficient handling of requests.
